# Project Images

Place your project preview images in this directory. The current project data expects the following images:

- `ecommerce.png` - E-Commerce Platform preview
- `taskmanager.png` - Task Management App preview  
- `portfolio.png` - Portfolio Website preview
- `analytics.png` - Analytics Dashboard preview

## Image Guidelines

- Recommended dimensions: 1200x675px (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Format: PNG or JPG
- Optimize for web to keep file sizes reasonable
- Use high-quality screenshots or mockups of your projects

## Updating Project Images

To change project images, simply replace the files in this directory or update the `image` property in the `app/projects/data.tsx` file to point to your new image paths.
